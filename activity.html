        <hr>
        <p>I am currently a life scout in <a href="https://www.troopwebhost.org/Troop201Honolulu/">Troop 201</a> finalizing
            my eagle rank. Throughout my scouting experience I met many people that have made a positive, profound impact
            on me. I have gone on many adventures from attending merit badge classes to being deluged by an insurmountable
            amount of rain during a scout camp. I started boy scouts back in 3rd grade for an unknown reason. To this day
            I have no idea why I joined boy scouts but I'm sure glad I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            At times there were hardships when it came to leadership because many of the younger scouts wouldn't listen, but in the end,
            everything worked out.

        <h4 class="display-4" style="padding-bottom: 15px">Track/Running</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Since it would be unhealthy to stay in my house all the time, I try to get exercise via running on my freetime
            and participating in track. When it comes to speed I admit that I don't excel at it but at the very least, I
            try. Although this is one of the many things that has taught me the concept of commitment, track is one of the
            heavier hitters. If I don't commit to consistently practicing, I start to gradually lose progress.
        </p>

        <h4 class="display-4" style="padding-bottom: 15px">Stocks</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>I'm not too sure if this is considered an "activity" but it's very fun to do. Although the stock market can be
            very risky and sometimes bearish, I always try to be a logical bull when it comes to investing. I won't disclose
            my total profit but I can verify that my total gain amounted to more than two pizzas. My stock adventure started
            back in 2017 but I was interested in it from way back when. Boy scouts had a eagle scout merit badge called "personal
            finance" in which stocks initially caught my eye.
